%\noindent Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials.
