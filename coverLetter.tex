\opening{Dear Mr. Shomberg} 
 
\noindent I am a former Naval Cryptologic Warfare Officer transisiting to the civilian workforce. I studied Mechanical Engineering in college, but entered Active Duty Service immediately after graduation. Last year, I requested and was granted seperation in order to pursue engineering once again. Since January, I have taken some much needed time off to travel and visit relitives. I am eager to return to work now, and I hope you will consider me for employment.

\noindent Through the Navy, I gained unique experiences and skills. The military pushed me to learn quickly and produce results from ill-defined problems. I have always prided myself on hard work and the ability to work autonomously. My superiors generously recognized me as a reliable worker, and allowed me to head increasingly challenging assignments.

\noindent In addition to my resume, I have attached my final Fitness Report written by CAPT Gagnon, the Commanding Officer of my primary command, and a PIM written by CDR Answee, the Commanding Officer on my final deployment. Classification prevents revealing many details from my previous work, but I hope these documents provide some clarity into the challenges involved.

\noindent I would like to arrange an interview to discuss potential employment. I am interested in working on full-time, part-time, or by contract. My current career priority is developing skills and building a portfolio. If you are interested in working with me, I am best reached by email, but feel free to contact me by any of the  means listed on my resume.
